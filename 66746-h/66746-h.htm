<p>The National Gallery of Art belongs to all the people of the United
States of America. Established by a joint resolution of Congress, it is
supported by public appropriation. The Board of Trustees consists of
four public servants, <i>ex officio</i>, and five private citizens. Chairman of
the Board is the Chief Justice of the United States. Under the policies
set by the Board, the Gallery assembles and maintains a collection of
paintings, sculpture, and the graphic arts, representative of the best in
the artistic heritage of America and Europe. Supported in its daily
operations by Federal funds, the Gallery is entirely dependent on the
generosity of private citizens for the works of art in its collections.</p>
<p>Funds for the construction of the original building were provided
by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust. During the
1920s, Mr. Mellon began to collect with the intention of forming a
national gallery of art in Washington. His collection was given to the
nation in 1937, the year of his death. In 1941, President Franklin D.
Roosevelt accepted the completed Gallery on behalf of the people of
the United States of America.</p>
<p>Architect for the National Gallery was John Russell Pope, who also
designed the Jefferson Memorial and other outstanding public buildings
in Washington. The building is one of the largest marble structures
in the world, measuring 780 feet in length and containing more
than 500,000 square feet of interior floor space. The exterior is of
rose-white Tennessee marble. The columns in the Rotunda were quarried
in Tuscany, Italy. Green marble from Vermont and gray marble
from Tennessee were used for the floor of the Rotunda. The interior
walls are of Alabama Rockwood stone, Indiana limestone, and Italian
travertine. The entire building is air-conditioned and humidity-controlled
throughout the year to maintain the optimum atmospheric
conditions for the works of art it contains.</p>
<p>The original building is no longer large enough to accommodate the
Gallery&rsquo;s acquisitions and interpretive art programs. A second building,
presently under construction, will house new exhibition galleries and
a Center for Advanced Study in the Visual Arts. The two buildings
will be connected by a plaza above ground and by a concourse of
public service areas, including a new caf&eacute;/buffet, below. The new
construction has been made possible by generous gifts from Mr. Paul
Mellon, the late Ailsa Mellon Bruce, and the Andrew W. Mellon
Foundation.</p>

<p class="tb">The paintings and sculpture given by the founder, Andrew W. Mellon,
comprising works by the greatest masters from the thirteenth to
the nineteenth century, have formed a nucleus of high quality around
which the collection has grown. Indeed, in making his gift Mr.
Mellon had expressed the hope that the newly established National
Gallery would attract gifts from other collectors, so that these works
of art might be enjoyed by all and would be a lasting contribution
to the cultural life of the nation.</p>
<p>Mr. Mellon&rsquo;s hope that others would carry on the work was realized,
even before the Gallery opened, by the action of Samuel H. Kress,
who gave to the nation his great collection of paintings and sculptures
of the Italian schools ranging from the thirteenth to the eighteenth
centuries. Enlarging and enriching the Kress Collection on
subsequent occasions, Samuel H. Kress and his brother Rush H.
Kress made the National Gallery outstanding for its representation
of Italian art and also added a distinguished group of French eighteenth-century
canvases and sculpture and fine examples of early
German paintings, as well as works of first importance from other
schools.</p>
<p>In 1942 Joseph E. Widener gave the famous collection of painting,
sculpture, and decorative arts formed by him and his father P.A.B.
Widener. Chester Dale, besides making numerous gifts during his
lifetime, bequeathed his extensive collection of nineteenth- and
twentieth-century French paintings to the Gallery. Ailsa Mellon
Bruce also bequeathed her collection of French paintings to the Gallery
and, in addition, generously provided funds for the purchase
of many old master paintings, including the Leonardo da Vinci.
Lessing J. Rosenwald has given over 20,000 prints and drawings.</p>
<p>In addition, more than 325 other donors have generously added to
the collections of the National Gallery of Art.</p>

<p class="pcap">ROTUNDA: Attributed to Adriaen de Vries, <i>Mercury</i>, cast probably c. 1603-1613</p>
</div>
<p>The vigorous movement, muscular lines, and above all the grace
and lightness of the bronze figure capture in this <i>Mercury</i> the fleeting
presence of an ancient god. Protector of the forlorn and travel
weary, patron of shepherds, merchants, wayfarers, and even thieves
fleeing the law, Mercury was the bearer of news and tidings for
the gods of mythology. He was known by his winged feet, a
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
traveler&rsquo;s cap with wings, and his herald&rsquo;s staff, a
<i>caduceus</i>, perhaps given him by Apollo, who had
the power of healing. The design of Mercury&rsquo;s
<i>caduceus</i> with its two serpents intertwined has been
traditionally associated with medicine and is the
adopted symbol of the medical profession. This
masterful piece was probably made by Adriaen de
Vries, a Dutch artist trained in Italy, and was
modeled after a <i>Mercury</i> completed twenty years
earlier by Giovanni Bologna.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">Florentine and Central Italian Art</span>
<br />(Galleries 1-10)</h2>
<p>Because the Church defined much of the social and cultural structure
of medieval life, Christian themes predominated as the subject
matter for the arts of the period. In the National Gallery collections,
works created in Florence, Siena, Rome, and Central Italy show the
range of skills and styles prevalent in painting as it progressed from
the highly religious art of the Middle Ages to the more secular art
of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>The usual technique for medieval religious art was egg tempera on
wood panels covered with a fine bone plaster, called gesso. Egg yolk
mixed with powdered pigments was applied to the gesso surface
resulting in pictures characterized by bright colors and clear outer
contours. To recall the radiant light of the heavenly kingdom
and to heighten the patterns typifying this art, the artist often used
gold-leafed grounds as well.</p>
<p>By the late fifteenth century, tempera gave way to oil paints that
dried more slowly, permitting the artist subtle modulations in his
color and allowing him to create realistic atmospheric effects. As
the Renaissance progressed, artists combined a renewed interest in
nature, analytical science, and classical humanism with the recently
developed techniques in media to bring about a corresponding realism
in art.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 1: Byzantine School, <i>Enthroned Madonna and
Child</i>, 13th century</p>
</div>
<p>A medieval walled city is transformed into a
throne by this imaginative, unknown artist to
symbolize the dominance of Christ and Mary,
Queen of Heaven, over the celestial city. To symbolize
Christ&rsquo;s rule on earth as well, the artist included,
in the rondels, images of angels bearing
orbs and scepters. So typical of the art of the
Byzantine Empire, this painting is an icon, or
holy image, and reflects within its composition a
fusion of ancient Roman and medieval Oriental
styles. A feeling for classical solidity shows in the
faces, which are modeled with cast shadows to suggest three-dimensional
forms, whereas a Near Eastern love of decoration accounts
for the flattened drapery patterns and their dazzling highlights.
The <i>Enthroned Madonna and Child</i> and another large Byzantine
icon of the same subject, also in this room, are among the
earliest paintings in the collection.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 3: Duccio, <i>The Calling of the Apostles Peter
and Andrew</i>, painted between 1308 and 1311</p>
</div>
<p>Called to be &ldquo;fishers of men,&rdquo; the
brothers Peter and Andrew pause in their
labors at the persuasive words of Christ.
In him, their future as apostles, or teachers,
and the future of mankind hang
momentarily suspended&mdash;like the net in
their hands. This panel is part of an
altarpiece commissioned for the high altar
of the Cathedral in Siena and called the
<i>Maest&agrave;</i> (&ldquo;majesty&rdquo;) because its central theme was the Virgin
splendidly enthroned with angels and saints. The purpose of this
piece, like so many medieval paintings, was to teach, and Duccio
arranged bright colors in simple shapes so that the story could
easily be recognized.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 4: Fra Angelico and Fra Filippi
Lippi, <i>The Adoration of the Magi</i>, painted c. 1445</p>
</div>
<p>Painted by two monks (<i>Fra</i> means &ldquo;friar&rdquo;),
this important painting fuses the concerns
and techniques of medieval and Renaissance
artists. The tapestrylike lawn, the
decorative bright colors, and the inverted
perspective of the shed are elements common
to medieval art. The realistic rendering
of birds and animals, the weight and
volume given the kneeling Magi in the foreground,
and the classically inspired nude figures at the distant left
reflect the new-found interest of the Renaissance in both classical
antiquity and the external world. The colorful, festive mood of the
painting, moreover, is emphasized by the bustling throngs of people
arriving to worship the Christ Child.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 4: Andrea del Castagno, <i>The Youthful David</i>,
painted c. 1450</p>
</div>
<p>Not simply a work of art, this painted leather
shield reflects the uniquely nationalistic consciousness
of the Florentine city-state. As a public
image carried in parades and ceremonies, its
function was to symbolize the Florentine struggle
for freedom and, as a gruesome depiction of
victory against oppression, to warn all potential
enemies of Florence. On the shield, both main
episodes of the Old Testament story appear concurrently:
David takes aim with his sling, while
the giant&rsquo;s head lies already severed at his feet. The effective,
although awkward, foreshortening of the upraised arm and the
sharply delineated veins and muscles attest to Castagno&rsquo;s Renaissance
interest in the realistic rendition of perspective and anatomy.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 6: Leonardo da Vinci, <i>Ginevra de&rsquo; Benci</i>,
painted c. 1480</p>
</div>
<p>With precise draftsmanship and an infinitely subtle manipulation
of light and shadow, Leonardo captures the character of a young
Florentine noblewoman of the fifteenth century. In her eyes he has
drawn a look of intelligence; in her bearing
and the set of her mouth, there is a
sense of determination and conviction.
Punning on the name of his sitter, the
artist has framed her head with a juniper
bush&mdash;<i>ginepro</i> in Italian&mdash;and decorated
the back of the panel with a juniper sprig.
Commissioned just after he completed an
apprenticeship with Verrocchio, this early
work is the only painting in the Western hemisphere accepted by
scholars as indisputably by Leonardo, one of the true geniuses of
the Renaissance.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/p03a.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="388" />
<p class="pcap">GALLERY 8: Raphael, <i>The Alba Madonna</i>, painted
c. 1510</p>
</div>
<p>The solidity and serenity of the figures derive
from the forms and poses seen in
ancient Roman sculpture and from the art
of Raphael&rsquo;s contemporaries, Leonardo
and Michelangelo. The equilibrium and
stability of the grouping provides not only
a freshness and majesty suitable for the
religious moment but also a source of contrast
to the subtle but painful implications
of the reed cross held by the two children. Named for the Spanish
Dukes of Alba who once owned it, the <i>Alba Madonna</i> is one of five
paintings by Raphael in the National Gallery of Art.</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">Venetian and North Italian Art</span>
<br />(Galleries 19-29)</h2>
<p>The splendor of Venetian art reflects the city&rsquo;s prosperity during its
years as a major Mediterranean port. Typical of Venetian lavishness
is <i>The Feast of the Gods</i> (gallery 22) by Giovanni Bellini,
Renaissance artist and teacher of Giorgione and Titian. This huge
painting draws from the fantasies of mythology, turning a Venetian
picnic into a feast for gods.</p>
<p>Aware of the subtle reflections of light and shadow playing in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
misty air over the lagoons of Venice, sixteenth-century artists such
as Titian, Veronese (gallery 28), and Tintoretto (gallery 29) strove
to capture the illusion of surface texture and tangible atmosphere
through their paints. Because oils blended easily together and because
one could thicken these paints with pigments, artists soon
established a more flexible technique. At the same time, they
abandoned rigid wood panels for canvas supports, which allowed
larger, lighter pictures. These innovations, combined with worldly
subjects, soon had a significant impact on the rest of Europe.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig8">

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 21: Giorgione, <i>The Adoration of the
Shepherds</i>, painted c. 1510</p>
</div>
<p>Dominated by a placid landscape bathed
in the half-light of dawn, Giorgione&rsquo;s
composition focuses on the small group
placed off-center in the foreground.
Rendering the Holy Family in luminous
colors, the artist has silhouetted them
against the dark mouth of a cave, a
traditional nativity setting borrowed
from Byzantine art that here reflects the
strong cultural ties between the city-state of Venice and the empire
to the east. This composition, one of the very few existing paintings
by the master, demonstrates Giorgione&rsquo;s mastery of color and control
of mood, elements which helped him to achieve fame during
his short life of thirty-three years.</p>

<p class="pcap">WEST SCULPTURE HALL: Jacopo Sansovino, <i>Venus
Anadyomene</i>, cast c. 1527-1530</p>
</div>
<p>One of the rare, life-sized bronzes of the Renaissance
now in the United States, the <i>Venus Anadyomene</i> is
of unparalleled elegance. While the softness of the
modeled forms and the vertical sweep of the curving
silhouette invest the nude with a heightened grace, her
twisting pose invites the viewer to move around the
statue, following the fluid line of her encircling arms.
Shown holding a seashell, a reflection of Venus&rsquo; birth
from the sea, this statue is appropriately entitled
<i>anadyomene</i>, &ldquo;rising from the waters.&rdquo; The artist, Jacopo
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Sansovino, was trained in Florence and Rome. Moving to Venice in
1527, this major high Renaissance sculptor and architect designed
or remodeled many important private and public buildings including
several palaces and the Library of Saint Mark.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 28. Titian, <i>Doge Andrea Gritti</i>, painted
c. 1535/1540</p>
</div>
<p>Typically Venetian was Titian&rsquo;s method of
starting with a dark preparatory ground, then
building up the forms with thin layers of oil
paint. Choosing the pose that best focuses our
attention, Titian has captured his sitter&rsquo;s restless
vitality in the turn of the doge&rsquo;s head
and the penetrating glance. By accentuating
the size and grasp of the hand and the bulk
of the body beneath the sumptuous ceremonial
robes, the artist has drawn a massive and
commanding presence befitting this renowned admiral and doge, or
duke of Venice. As seen here, the figure seems to emerge quite
powerfully from the shadow, and the predominant hues of red and
yellow have a rich, smoldering quality.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">Italian Art of the 17th and 18th Centuries</span>
<br />(Galleries 33, 34, 36, 37; Lobby A, West Stair Hall, and Rotunda Stair Hall)</h2>
<p>The baroque period began around 1600, when the Church was engaged
in a movement to curb the spreading of the Protestant Reformation.
To appeal to the large numbers of ambivalent Christians
torn between the two theologies, the Catholic clergy commissioned
and supported a realistic but dramatic art designed to involve the
populace in the teachings and the authority of the Church. Indeed,
so appealing was the baroque style that it was quickly adapted to
the worldly subjects of the secular arts. Representative of the
Counter-Reformation era is Gian Lorenzo Bernini, an enormously
successful and influential architect and sculptor. As world trade
shifted to the Atlantic nations, however, Italy&rsquo;s economic position
declined, and by the eighteenth century many Italian painters had
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
to search for commissions elsewhere in Europe. Through their
travels, decorative painters and muralists, such as Giovanni Battista
Tiepolo, soon established an international style filled with brilliant
colors and virtuoso brushwork.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="" width="334" height="436" />
<p class="pcap">LOBBY A: Gian Lorenzo Bernini, <i>Monsignor Francesco
Barberini</i>, carved c. 1624/1625</p>
</div>
<p>A masterful example of the immediacy of
baroque art, this bust of the uncle of Matteo
Barberini, who became Pope Urban VIII,
captures the textural qualities of living flesh.
Through Bernini&rsquo;s virtuosity, the highly
polished forehead gives the illusion of glossy
skin, whereas the starched fabric has been
left with a rough, light-absorbing surface. To
create a thoughtful expression, Bernini has
exaggerated the depth of the eye sockets, casting
deep shadows. Such a convincing portrayal of aging flesh and
stern character&mdash;commissioned by the pope as a tribute to his uncle&mdash;is
all the more impressive since Bernini had never seen the long-dead
Francesco Barberini. The bee on the pedestal is the emblem
of the Barberini, a wealthy Roman family.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig12">
<img src="images/p04b.jpg" alt="" width="393" height="429" />
<p class="pcap">GALLERY 33: Orazio Gentileschi, <i>The Lute Player</i>,
painted c. 1610</p>
</div>
<p>The most casual elements of this intimate
portrait of human activity combine to
create a masterful composition of complex
and dynamic parts. The pose of the
girl, shown with arm and head poised
as she tunes her lute, generates a feeling
of sustained movement. The intricate still
life fading into shadowy depths at the left
is in deliberate contrast to the brightly lit
costume and solid figure of the lute
player. The combination of abrupt spotlighting and suggested deep
space was characteristic of baroque painting in seventeenth-century
Rome, and Gentileschi, an international court artist, transmitted this
robust style to Genoa, Paris, and London.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 36: Giovanni Paolo Panini, <i>The Interior of
the Pantheon</i>, painted c. 1740</p>
</div>
<p>In an era of travel, when men and women of
wealth toured the continent as part of their
education, factual renderings of interiors and
cityscapes became important souvenirs. A
major attraction on the Grand Tour during
the eighteenth century was Rome; and in
Rome, the Pantheon, a circular temple built
in the second century. Converted to a Christian
church, it became the burial spot of
Renaissance authors and artists, such as
Raphael, and has proved the source of inspiration for many later
structures, including the central rotunda of the National Gallery.
Panini was the greatest view painter in Rome during the 1700s,
although his precise manner of painting was paralleled by his Venetian
contemporaries, Canaletto and Guardi.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">Flemish and German Art</span>
<br />(Galleries 35, 35A, 39-43)</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the fifteenth century, northern European art was
caught up by the same spirit of empirical inquiry and technical innovation
that predominated in Italy during this period. Northern art,
however, reflects neither the influence of classical art nor the development
of a single-point perspective that are the hallmarks of the
Italian Renaissance. Rather, Netherlandish artists such as Jan van
Eyck achieved mastery in the new technique of oil painting. The
use of oil on wood panel permitted an extraordinary increase in the
depth and richness of color, which, in turn, was coupled with the
tradition of minute, craftsmanly detail established in late medieval
manuscript illumination.</p>
<p>Around 1500, Italian humanism and Renaissance science had a
discernable effect upon northern European painting. Albrecht D&uuml;rer
(gallery 35A) and Francois Clouet (gallery 41) both profited from
their exposure to Italian art. The Renaissance influence carried over
into the work of Rubens in the seventeenth century despite the religious
and political upheaval of the Reformation which affected so
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
much European art of the mid-1500s. Catholic Flanders, the home
of Rubens, remained relatively untouched by the changing times
and maintained a continuity of political and economic ties to the
Spanish monarchy. Rubens, who drew heavily from the work of
earlier Italian masters, at the same time developed a baroque preference
for large-scale canvases and bravura brushwork, transmitting
this style to his associate van Dyck.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 39: Jan van Eyck, <i>The Annunciation</i>, painted
c. 1425/1430</p>
</div>
<p>The sacred setting of a medieval church provides the
backdrop to van Eyck&rsquo;s interpretation of the Annunciation.
The archangel Gabriel, dressed in jewels and
rich fabrics, greets Mary: &ldquo;Hail Mary, full of grace.&rdquo;
The simply gowned young virgin lifts her hands in
wonder and replies, &ldquo;Behold the handmaiden of the
Lord.&rdquo; The two Latin phrases (Mary&rsquo;s is written upside-down)
reinforce the contrast and balance between
these two important figures: Gabriel in his sumptuous
attire and with wings in rainbow colors stands slightly
in front in a partially turned position, whereas
Mary in her subdued glory sits slightly behind the angel and faces
forward. Following the established tradition of the story, van Eyck
added a lily, symbol of purity, and a dove, symbol of the Holy
Spirit. He also decorated the floor tiles with Old Testament scenes
prefiguring the life and triumph of Christ&mdash;Samson destroys the
Philistine temple and David slays Goliath. This subtle integration
of religious history into the background of the painting is indicative
of the late medieval belief that objects of the external world are
imbued with religious symbolism.</p>

painted c. 1510</p>
</div>
<p>One of the few surviving paintings by Gr&uuml;newald, this crucifixion
amply displays the emotional power of this German Renaissance
artist. Set against a sky darkened by an eclipse of the sun, the
scarred and haggard body of Christ makes the scene painfully and
physically immediate. With the agonized gesture of the hands, the
ragged loincloth, the dislocated shoulders, and twisted feet, little
remains to soften the tension of the painting; rather, the artist
emphasizes the human suffering necessary for
Christ to redeem mankind. Painted on the eve
of the Protestant Reformation, this panel reflects
the growing insistence in northern Europe
upon the reality and importance of private
religious experiences.</p>

<p>Scholar, collector, diplomat, and one
of the finest artists of his century,
Rubens was famed for the boundless
enthusiasm and technical wizardry of
his paintings. This monumental piece
was executed early in Rubens&rsquo; career.
Its impact depends not only upon its
large scale but also upon the baroque
combination of the theatrical&mdash;the dramatic lighting and Daniel&rsquo;s
expressive pose&mdash;with a convincing realism&mdash;the lifelike postures
and superbly rendered lions&rsquo; fur.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 42: Sir Anthony van Dyck, <i>Queen Henrietta
Maria with Her Dwarf</i>, painted probably in 1633</p>
</div>
<p>Painted in London, this depiction of Henrietta
Maria, wife of Britain&rsquo;s Charles I and sister of
France&rsquo;s Louis XIII, is a prime example of the
baroque &ldquo;Grand Manner&rdquo; portrait. Analysis of
character is sacrificed in favor of a stately and
essentially flattering mode of presentation; the
glittering crown, for example, recalls Henrietta

<br />(Galleries 44-49)</h2>
<p>The United Netherlands was founded in 1609 as a Protestant nation
following bitter wars of liberation from Catholic Spain. The combination
of excellent seaports, a powerful navy, and strong mercantile
interests made Holland a flourishing economic center. Dutch patrons,
predominantly Calvinist and middle class, demanded not religious
or mythological pictures, but landscapes, portraits, still lifes, and
genres, or scenes of daily life. Their demands were met by an ever-increasing
number of Dutch artists who, perhaps in response to a
burgeoning and competitive market, specialized in a single type of
subject. Thus Frans Hals was famed for his portraits, Kalf for his
still lifes, and Ruisdael and Hobbema for their landscapes. The one
exception was Rembrandt, whose penetrating insight into the human
condition and whose superb technical facility enabled him to explore
successfully a variety of subjects. Holland&rsquo;s artistic boom was
soon ended, however, for as quickly as it arose, the economic and
artistic Golden Age declined during the last years of the seventeenth
century.</p>

<p>One aspect of Vermeer&rsquo;s genius was his ability
to create a poetry of the obvious, to
transmute a mundane scene into an evocative
moment. In what appears at first to be
a simple depiction of a woman holding a
pair of scales, a framed painting of the
Last Judgment included on the back wall of
the scene suggests a more serious, allegorical
meaning. Weighing the souls of mankind
serves as a point of comparison to the woman weighing her worldly
possessions. Vermeer&rsquo;s incomparable sensitivity in rendering effects
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
of light can be seen in the careful modulation of the cool, muted
daylight that fills the room. Especially striking are the touches of
pure white paint that highlight the fur collar and the pearls on the
table. The stable, geometric gridwork formed by the table, picture
frame, and window reinforce the calm and serious mood.</p>

<p>This still life reveals more than a study of
inanimate objects positioned in light and
shadow; it also betrays the artist&rsquo;s interest
in the lively microcosmic worlds unnoticed
in our daily life. Using more than twenty
varieties of blossoms, including roses, tulips,
morning-glories, and candytuft, de Heem
weaves the blooms, overflowing in the insect-inhabited
shadows, into the arrangement of
sunlit flowers thriving in the central area of
the painting. Since none of the flowers bloom concurrently, the
artist portrayed them either from illustrations in botanical texts
or from his own studies made during different times of the year.
Such interest in the cycle of the seasons and the transience of life,
as reflected in this symbolic bouquet, is frequently seen in Dutch
flower painting.</p>

<p>The some sixty self-portraits painted by Rembrandt
during his long career form a unique
visual autobiography. In early life, he was
Amsterdam&rsquo;s leading portraitist and narrative
painter and a wealthy man. Later, ravaged
by bankruptcy and personal misfortunes,
Rembrandt became increasingly introspective.
In this self-portrait, painted when he was
fifty-three, all but the essential forms are concealed
in shadow. Light appears to emanate
from the face itself, although the eyes are veiled in a mysterious
half-shadow. Rembrandt&rsquo;s technical genius enabled him to create
subtle nuances even within a restricted range of color; the golden
light glistening from his forehead merges with the blue-gray at the
temples. All of Rembrandt&rsquo;s painterly skill was used, ultimately, to
confront us with a candid self-appraisal that neither flatters nor
disparages. (The National Gallery has a wide range of Rembrandt
paintings in galleries 45 and 48.)</p>

<p>Imported by the royal courts or commissioned by the Church, foreign
artists dominated the arts of Spain during the fifteenth and
sixteenth centuries. Juan de Flandes, a Flemish painter (galleries
38 and 39), served the court of Ferdinand and Isabella, and El
Greco (gallery 30), a Greek who studied in Venice and Rome,
settled and worked in Toledo. By the 1600s, Spain had become an
economic and cultural force in Europe, her power sustained in
large part by the wealth of her vast American colonies. Seville was
then the artistic capital of Spain; Zurbar&aacute;n, Vald&eacute;s Leal, Murillo,
who founded an academy there in 1660, and Vel&aacute;zquez all worked
in Seville. After moving to Madrid, Vel&aacute;zquez served Philip IV
as court painter and director of the royal museum. The greatest
Spanish artist of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries
was Francisco de Goya, who was court portraitist to a succession of
corrupt monarchs and French conquerors. It should not be forgotten,
too, that the twentieth-century artist Pablo Picasso (gallery
76) was first active in Barcelona before emigrating to France.</p>

often worked in a satirical mode to capture
the realities of war and the tyranny and

the artist has given us a marvelously

peculiarly Spanish sense of pride and self-discipline
is evident in Sabasa Garc&iacute;a&rsquo;s
aristocratic posture and bold, unflinching gaze. Equally direct is
Goya&rsquo;s manner of painting, which captures the rough texture of the
shawl as well as the gossamer quality of the mantilla lace. The result
is a portrait of great intensity heightened by feminine beauty.</p>

<br />(Galleries 33, 44, 52-56, East Sculpture Hall, and Lobby C)</h2>
<p>Troubled by the Catholic-Huguenot wars and civil wars of the
previous century, seventeenth-century France followed a course of
aggression against foreign monarchies and of consolidation within
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
the French state. Most heavily supported by the royal court, French
artists were sent to Rome to study the arts of the Italian Renaissance
and classical antiquity; some, like Claude Lorrain and Nicolas
Poussin (gallery 52), chose to remain in Italy. In Paris, an
Academy, which rapidly became the ruling body for French art,
was established in 1648. To enhance the brilliance of his reign in
the latter part of the century, Louis XIV sponsored a ceremonial
art&mdash;more idealistic than realistic in style&mdash;and built near Paris the
largest palace in Europe, Versailles. The fountains in the National
Gallery&rsquo;s East and West Garden Courts once stood in the gardens
of Versailles and still bear traces of the lavish gold leaf that originally
covered them.</p>
<p>Under Louis XV and Louis XVI in the eighteenth century, French
society became more relaxed and informal. Most apparent in the
decorative arts, the move to a lighter, more graceful style affected
painting as well. The new style, rococo, was first developed by
Watteau (galleries 53 and 54), who used a carefree delicacy, pastel
colors, and gracefully curving lines. After the French Revolution of
1789, a school of neoclassical artists dominated painting, using
themes of patriotic heroism and stressing severe beauty of line and
firm modeling, over light and color.</p>

<p>Within the melancholy darkness of this
painting, the dim light reveals emblems of
the vanity and brevity of life: a skull, book,
and mirror. Eliminating unnecessary detail,
La Tour makes us focus on the inward,
spiritual aspect of his themes, through monumental
shapes and a nearly abstract geometry
of forms. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s fingers
touching the skull, for instance, are emphasized
in stark angularity against the light
from the hidden flame. Like Vermeer, La Tour is a rediscovery of
recent years. Although highly respected in his lifetime, La Tour
slipped into obscurity, and only thirty-eight of his paintings survive
today. A court painter to Louis XIII, La Tour was noted for his
&ldquo;nocturnes,&rdquo; which generate a mood of isolation by their dense
shadows that envelop the composition.</p>

the figures at the near left, where three
goddesses gather round the Prince of
Troy, Paris. Chosen to judge the women on their beauty, Paris is
bribed by Venus, here accompanied by her son Cupid, and accepts
her aid in abducting Helen, Queen of Sparta. Claude&rsquo;s vision of
this episode, which eventually touched off the Trojan War, is a fine
example of his ability both to ennoble and to idealize nature, and
it was this mode of painting which was to dominate European landscape
painting for the next two centuries.</p>

Fragonard&rsquo;s fascination with the irregular

<br />(Galleries 57-59 and 61)</h2>
<p>The history of sixteenth-century England was characterized by unstable,
often short-lived alliances made with her several continental
neighbors. No wonder then that the influx and influence of foreign
artists during this and the following century reflects the diversity of
political ties between England and Europe. In the 1500s, the German
Hans Holbein the Younger (gallery 40) was court artist to Henry
VIII soon after that monarch&rsquo;s audacious break with the Church,
and in the 1600s the Fleming, Anthony van Dyck (galleries 42 and
43), was in the employ of Charles I.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>In the eighteenth century, however, when England became a leading
maritime and industrial nation under George III and George IV, a
large group of native British painters emerged, and in 1768 the
Royal Academy was founded in London. The portraitists were led
by Sir Joshua Reynolds, first president of the Royal Academy, and
Thomas Gainsborough, noted for his virtuoso brushwork. Among
their contemporaries and followers were Romney, Hoppner, Raeburn
and Lawrence. In the early 1800s, England produced two
landscapists who achieved international reputations. Constable was
basically a realist in his study of scenes in natural light; Turner,
however, was a romantic who interpreted the moods of nature.</p>

and the powerful mood of nature to establish
a perfect setting for this celebrated actress and
wife of the playwright and politician Sheridan.
Born Elizabeth Linley, she was Gainsborough&rsquo;s
lifelong friend. A motif common to the eighteenth
century, the Age of Enlightenment, was
the use of nature and an informal pose to
achieve unaffected simplicity. In this portrait,
however, early signs of romanticism are clearly
seen in the dramatic quality of the blowing trees and windswept
figure contrasted with the calm features of the finely modeled face.
Gainsborough normally painted under candlelight to give a glow
and flickering liveliness to his sitters and sometimes used six-foot-long
brushes to avoid finicky detailing.</p>

<br />(Galleries 60, 60A, 60B, 62, and 64-68)</h2>
<p>Established as a subculture of the mother country, the American
colonies looked to England for leadership in the arts. Ambitious
painters, finding no opportunity for formal training in the colonies,
went to study in Europe. Benjamin West, a Pennsylvania Quaker,
after three years in Italy, in 1763 established himself in London,
where he achieved such renown that he became History Painter to
King George III and was later appointed second president of the
Royal Academy of Arts. Until after the Civil War, the best training
was still abroad, but usually the American students returned to the
United States, where a growing urban society with more leisure
was providing a market for works of art.</p>
<p>During the first half of the nineteenth century, many untrained
artists, working in the cities but more often traveling about the
countryside, provided na&iuml;ve or primitive pictures for the ever-increasing
middle classes. Up to this time the artist had been mainly a
portraitist; but with the invention of the camera in 1839 he had to
shift his emphasis, and by mid-century America had a thriving
school of landscape painters, whose works fed a national pride in
the great wild terrain of the New World. After the Civil War, however,
these landscapes also appealed to a populace seeking relief in
the ideal world of a quiet countryside away from the humdrum of
dirty cities that were springing up everywhere, the result of the
Industrial Revolution.</p>
<p>Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer were the great turn-of-the-century
artists. They portrayed American life and scenery with
straightforward candor. Their example has been carried on by some
modern American artists who, fascinated with the urban growth of
the 1900s, have emphasized the vitality of city life. These include
painters such as Henri, Bellows, and Sloan. More recently abstract
art has been in the forefront of American painting.</p>

The lack of personality in the face infuriated critics; they failed to
realize that this was not intended as a portrait. Whistler, an American
expatriate, was exercising his artistic theories by exploring a
single tone&mdash;white. The starched cuffs, striped sleeves, cambric
skirt, brocade curtain, and fur rug create a &ldquo;Symphony in White,&rdquo;
as Whistler once titled this work. The fullness of the girl&rsquo;s lips,
the thick richness of her chestnut hair, and her wide blue eyes,
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
however, mark a subtle but uneasy contrast to the
purity of the white color. This tension is carried
further by the presence of the bearskin and the
garish flowers wilting on the floor, symbolic, perhaps,
of a bestiality of nature and an innocence
lost. To emphasize the color relationships around
this woman, his mistress Joanna Hiffernan, Whistler
flattened the space and avoided strong lights and

<br />(Galleries 72, 77, and 83-93)</h2>
<p>French art during the second half of the 1800s is noted for its
innovation and its diversity. Yet, although the paintings produced
during this period differ in their visual effects, the artists of these
works were all largely concerned with the same problem: how to
treat nature and how to define reality. Thus, in reaction to the
neoclassicists, who stressed line and color, and the romantics, who
favored lush hues, exotic or unusual subject matter, and emotionalism,
the realists sought to paint only what was before them, free
from embellishment. Other artists such as Monet and Renoir concentrated
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
upon recording the fleeting and subtle color impressions
created by changes in sunlight. Because their technique was rapid
and sketchy, these latter artists gave less attention to studiously
modeled form, and their paintings, although &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; in their
rendition of light and space, do not have the solid, tangible qualities
so evident in Academic painting. (The Gallery&rsquo;s collections are
particularly comprehensive in the works of Manet, Renoir, and
Degas. Included also is Mary Cassatt, the only American who exhibited
with the impressionists.) Still other artists rejected impressionism&rsquo;s
concern with transitory moments in order to express
either their intuitive reactions to the natural world or their personalized
interpretation of the physical laws that order appearances.
Reality was redefined by these artists, such as Gauguin, van Gogh,
Toulouse-Lautrec, and C&eacute;zanne, who were known as post-impressionists.
It was their work which prepared the way for twentieth-century
expressionism and abstraction.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 93: Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, <i>Forest of
Fontainebleau</i>, painted c. 1830</p>
</div>
<p>Amid the controversies of nineteenth-century
French art criticism, Corot
was a transitional figure. Popular
with conservative patrons, he was
also a champion of the younger, radical
painters. This scene in a forest
near Paris is composed of traditional
elements: the overlapping planes of
light and dark foliage and a deep perspective established by the
path of light and space running through the painting&rsquo;s center.
Corot&rsquo;s treatment of light, studied directly from nature, is quite
modern, however, as he exactly captures the harsh glare and heavy
shadow caused by strong sun.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 83: Edouard Manet, <i>Gare Saint-Lazare</i>,
dated 1873</p>
</div>
<p>Overlooking Paris&rsquo; Saint-Lazare railroad yards, this sun-drenched
scene is the first major picture Manet executed out-of-doors. Though
influenced by his friends, the impressionists Monet and Renoir,
Manet&rsquo;s disciplined temperament rejected
impressionism&rsquo;s less structured
effects. The rigid lines of the iron fence,
for example, act as a foil for the figures&rsquo;
curves. The little girl, whose interest lies
on the rail yards behind, forms a subtle
tension with the woman who gazes out
at the viewer. The color scheme, with its
reversal of colors, serves both to unify the pattern and to underscore
the separation of the two figures: the full womanly figure is
dressed in blue accented with white, whereas the childish figure is
in white accented with blue.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 90: Auguste Renoir, <i>A Girl with a Watering
Can</i>, dated 1876</p>
</div>
<p>Wanting to capture the dazzling colors found
in strong sunlight, the impressionist painter
Renoir intensified the natural hues of reality to
a greater vibrancy on canvas. The green of
the grass depicted here is more intense in hue
than that which one might expect to find in
nature, and the gravel path sparkles like gems.
In calculating the juxtaposition of color, the
artist placed pale blue-green shadows on the
child&rsquo;s face to heighten her rosy complexion.
In addition, the blurred impressionist brushstrokes create the effect
of shimmering sunlight dissolving form and detail. Once in response
to criticism about his work, Renoir said, &ldquo;There are enough things
to bore us in life without our making more of them.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 86: Claude Monet, <i>Rouen Cathedral, West
Facade</i>, dated 1894</p>
</div>
<p>Monet, a founder of impressionism, became obsessed
with the variations with natural light. From
1892 to 1895, he recorded in a series of paintings
a medieval French cathedral as it appeared at
different times of day or under different weather
conditions. In over thirty canvases of Rouen
Cathedral, Monet&rsquo;s analyses of light on the cathedral&rsquo;s
surfaces resulted in iridescent colors and
thick paint textures that are visually sensational
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
yet highly naturalistic. Here, in early morning, the church shimmers
lavender and violet, the stone of the upper portions glowing
in the rich red-orange of the rising sun. Another from the Rouen
series, showing the church in the yellow-white heat of the afternoon,
is also in this room.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 85: Edgar Degas, <i>Four Dancers</i>, painted
c. 1899</p>
</div>
<p>One of Degas&rsquo; own favorite works, this,
his last major oil painting, has a chalky
texture reminiscent of the pastels he frequently
used. Studying the strong patterns
in Japanese prints as well as the snapshot
effects of photography, this superb
draftsman often designed his paintings
with an angled point of view or created
an off-center balance, cutting off figures by the frame edge. With
the increasing abstraction of his late style, Degas here used a black
outline which not only separates the gestures of the dancers but
also accents their red apparel, intensifying the theatrical effect.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 85: Paul C&eacute;zanne, <i>Still Life</i>, painted c. 1894</p>
</div>
<p>Most evident in this painting is the tension
between what is, on the one hand,
a rendition of nature and, on the other,
C&eacute;zanne&rsquo;s deliberate organization of the
shapes into a rhythm of forms. The
swirls and eddies of the blue drapery
are reflected in the curves of the apples,
peppermint bottle, white linen, and
carafe. At the same time, horizontal or vertical lines dominate
along the edge of the table, the molding of the back wall, and the
neck of the bottle, creating a linear grid that offsets and balances
the curving lines. The blue-green tonality, in addition to the geometric
patterning, further demonstrates the artist&rsquo;s intent to visually
organize and unify. Indeed, for the sake of unity, C&eacute;zanne has even
distorted the carafe by swelling it out on one side, pulling it deeper
into the folds of the fabric.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">20th-Century Art</span>
<br />(Gallery 76 and West Stair Hall)</h2>
<p>Flattened shapes, strong outlines, unmodulated hues, and pronounced
pigment textures have been among the central devices of
many twentieth-century painters. Artists have often abandoned the
direct imitation of reality, preferring instead to work through complex
problems of pictorial design to express human feelings. A tremendous
diversity of artistic styles has resulted, emerging in tempo
with the rapid changes of modern society and technology. The National
Gallery&rsquo;s present collection of modern art concentrates on the
French school prior to World War I, the period when Paris was
the cultural center of Europe.</p>
<p>With the opening of the East Building, the National Gallery will
have increased space for the display of contemporary art.</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 76: Pablo Picasso, <i>Family of Saltimbanques</i>,
painted in 1905</p>
</div>
<p>Obsessed in 1905 with the theme of the
circus, Picasso sought the company of
performers not only as potential subjects
for his paintings but also as companions.
Their agility and grace delighted him;
their gypsy lives intrigued him, as did
their professional pursuit of the fine art
of illusion. The circus family in this
painting is assembled in a lonely landscape
devoid of any living thing. Their static poses suggest that
each member, caught up in reverie, is unaware of the others. A
sense of equilibrium is maintained, however, in the compact shape
of the five figures at the left balanced against the single figure in
the right foreground. The pastel tints of red, violet, and blue, moreover,
create an aura of elegiac melancholy. Although Picasso has
abandoned the predominantly blue palette of his earlier, more pensive
work, the <i>Family of Saltimbanques</i> still exudes a feeling of
pathos and isolation. (The thirteen paintings by Picasso in the
National Gallery represent the major phases within the first half of
Picasso&rsquo;s career.)</p>

<p class="pcap">GALLERY 76: Georges Braque, <i>Still Life: Le Jour</i>,
dated 1929</p>
</div>
<p>Although common, everyday items, the
objects in this painting are not shown in
an everyday arrangement. Rather,
through a precise, rational manipulation
of shapes, the artist has so structured
the objects as to arrive at a fresh
understanding of their reality. The
pitcher and the wineglass, for example,
are each shown as an overview of the rim (presenting one angle of
vision) and a profile view of the object&rsquo;s body (presenting a second
angle of vision); these and other aspects of the objects are combined
to reveal a new, but nonetheless accurate, perception of the
object. And, as Braque intended, it is this flattened perception that,
throughout the composition, constantly reminds us of the two-dimensional
surface of the canvas. Braque&rsquo;s geometric compositions&mdash;which
to outraged critics were nothing more than &ldquo;cubes&rdquo;&mdash;were
one aspect of a style known as cubism which developed shortly
after the turn of the century.</p>

<p class="pcap">WEST STAIR HALL: Salvador Dali, <i>The Sacrament of
the Last Supper</i>, dated 1955</p>
</div>
<p>Known neither for his Christian
themes nor for simplicity of organization,
Dali has in this painting
moved away from the surrealism that
preoccupied him during his earlier
years. The composition of the <i>Last
Supper</i> is clearly defined in two main
planes: foreground action and background scenery. The placement
of the figures is symmetrical with a mirror-image repetition of the
same figures from one side of the painting to the other. The men,
their faces hidden, are more the idealized participants in a timeless
Eucharist than specific men of a specific time and place. The
strange translucent enclosure&mdash;a geometrical dodecahedron&mdash;is
meant to be understood as part earthly, part celestial. The enigma
of this intellectual and complex painting centers finally in the all-embracing
arms&mdash;symbolic of the heavens and of the creator, who
is seen as youthful rather than patriarchal but whose face is hidden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">Decorative Arts</span></h2>
<p>As objects for daily use, the decorative arts allow a close insight
into cultures of the past. Among its holdings, the National Gallery
has an extensive collection of European furniture, tapestries, and
ceramics from the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries as well as
medieval church vessels and Renaissance jewelry. In addition, there
is a fine selection of eighteenth-century French furniture&mdash;including
many pieces signed by cabinetmakers to Louis XV and Louis XVI
and, of historic interest, the writing table used by Queen Marie
Antoinette while she was imprisoned three years during the French
Revolution (gallery 55). The Gallery also contains a large collection
of Chinese porcelains, including porcelains from the Ch&rsquo;ing Dynasty
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.</p>
<p>Until the East Building is completed, only a few selected works can
be placed on exhibition in the galleries.</p>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="small">Prints and Drawings</span></h2>
<p>The collection of prints and drawings at the National Gallery contains
about fifty thousand examples from the fifteenth century to the
present time. Included are drawings by D&uuml;rer, Rembrandt, Rubens,
and Blake, as well as a wide range of prints by the major graphic
artists of the Western World. The National Gallery&rsquo;s collection incorporates
an extremely fine selection of early Northern woodcuts
and engravings and one of the most important groups of eighteenth-century
French prints, drawings, and book illustrations outside of
France. There is also an excellent group of early manuscript illuminations.</p>
<p>Visitors may examine prints and drawings not on exhibition by
appointment with a curator in the Department of Graphic Arts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">Index of American Design</span></h2>
<p>The Index of American Design is a collection of watercolor renderings
of objects of popular art in the United States from before 1700
until about 1900. The renderings represent American ceramics, furniture,
woodcarving, glassware, metalwork, tools and utensils, textiles,
costumes, and other types of American craftsmanship. There
are some seventeen thousand renderings and about five hundred
photographs. These are available for study, by appointment.
The works themselves may be loaned to organizations for exhibition
outside the Gallery.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.
</div>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&#8482; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.&#8221;
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than

forth in Section 3 below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
